<h1>Security Awareness Training</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

üé• **Overview**
  - Created a training video addressing AWS S3 bucket security based on SEGA Europe's real-world data exposure incident.

üîç **Key Points**
  - Risk Highlight: SEGA's misconfigured S3 bucket incident underscores the common risk of leaks.
  - Incident Impact: Examined real-world consequences, including exposed API keys, messaging systems, and user data.
  - Best Practices: Shared insights on securing AWS S3 buckets and promoting responsible disclosure.

üöÄ **Objectives**
  - Raise awareness about AWS S3 security risks.
  - Highlight real-world impact with SEGA case study.
  - Encourage best practices and responsible disclosure in the cybersecurity community.

<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>

**Step 1: Identifying the Opportunity**  
Between threat modeling and keeping up to date with current cybersecurity news, I chose to use a real-world occurrence as an opportunity for security awareness training within my organization. I selected the Sega data breach incident ([Read more](https://threatpost.com/sega-security-aws-s3-exposed-steam/177352/)) as a case study.

Understanding the ramifications of this real-world event, I identified the people within my organization who would benefit from learning about this event from a security perspective. In this case, anyone who uses cloud storage, specifically AWS.

**Step 2: Developing the Outline**  
In order to properly educate these individuals, I developed an outline to guide how I would provide the education:

- Make the people within my organization understand the risk associated with AWS S3 buckets, and support them in understanding it.
- Emphasize the risk of insecure AWS S3 buckets.
- Educate them on how to secure AWS S3 buckets properly.

**Step 3: Creating the Video**  
I created a short video addressing the risks associated with AWS S3 Buckets. Check it out below:

**Step 4: Communication via Email**  
To disseminate this message, I sent out an email containing a link to the video:

**Step 5: Repeating the Process**  
I would repeat steps 1-4 by creating more security awareness training content, typically once a week.
